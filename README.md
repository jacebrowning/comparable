Comparable is a library providing abstract base classes that enable subclasses to be compared for "equality" and "similarity" based on their attributes.



Getting Started
===============

Requirements
------------

* Python 3.3: http://www.python.org/download/releases/3.3.4/#download


Installation
------------

Comparable can be installed with 'pip':

    pip install Comparable

Or directly from the source code:

    git clone https://github.com/jacebrowning/comparable.git
    cd comparable
    python setup.py install



Basic Usage
===========

After installation, abstract base classes can be imported from the package:

    python
    >>> import comparable
    comparable.__version__
    >>> from comparable import SimpleComparable, CompoundComparable

Comparable classes use `==` as the operation for "equality" and `%` as the operation for "similarity". They may also override a `threshold` attribute to set the "similarity" ratio.


Simple Comparables
------------------

Simple comparable types must override the `equality` and `similarity` methods to return bool and Similarity objects, respectively. See `comparable.simple` for examples.


Compound Comparables
--------------------

Compound comparable types contain multiple simple comparable types. They must override the `attributes` property to define which attributes should be used for comparison. See `comparable.compund` for examples.



Examples
========

Comparable includes many generic comparable types:

    python
    >>> from comparable.simple import Number, Text, TextEnum, TextTitle
    >>> from comparable.compound import Group

A basic script may look similar to the following:

    from comparable.simple import TextTitle
    from comparable import tools

    base = TextTitle("The Cat and the Hat")
    items = [TextTitle("cat & hat"), TextTitle("cat & the hat")]

    print("Equality: {}".format(base == items[0]))
    print("Similarity: {}".format(base % items[0]))

    print("Duplicates: {}".format(tools.duplicates(base, items)))
